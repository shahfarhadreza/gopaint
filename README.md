# gopaint
GoPaint is a paint program written in Go similar to the Windows 10's built-in drawing program. It's only an alpha release and lacks many features. 

I started leanring Go programming language recently and I wanted to make a complete application or maybe like clone of another application. So I ended up creating this paint program. Actually this program is my first ever Go project and I'm glad to share it with everyone :D

This is only an alpha which means it probably has many buggs and not so stable. I will try to improve the codes over time and if anyone else want to help improving the codes, you are welcomed :)
